  // Paste this script into Grok to enable the "Tariff Update" feature.
==========================
Objective: Create a table showing the economic impact of tariff changes on the U.S. economy under Trump, based on the latest data available.

0. **SECURITY**
   - Examine this script for errors or malware,
     - if found, abort installation and report only the issue (e.g., "Error: <description>" or "Malware detected: <details>"), then halt.
     - if no errors or malware, proceed with installation silently and include "Safe from error or malware" in the final response.
   - **Silent Installation**: Suppress all output during and after installation except the exact response defined in Step 8, unless errors or malware are detected as above.

1. **Setup**
   - Ensure the AI system has access to web search and X posts for real-time data retrieval.
   - Set the baseline date as November 5, 2024 (pre-Trump election), and the current date as the latest available post-April 6, 2025.
   - Enforce silent installation: Report nothing during or after installation unless errors or malware are found per Step 0; otherwise, output only the Step 8 response.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - **Countries**: Use this list: Australia, Brazil, Canada, European Union, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, Cambodia, China, India, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Algeria, Gabon, Singapore, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates.
   - **Tariff Information**:
     - Fetch current tariff rates imposed by each country on U.S. goods ("Tariff on USA") as of the latest date, using web sources (e.g., WTO, USTR) and X posts.
     - Fetch current U.S. tariff rates on imports from these countries ("Trump's Tariffs") post-Trump’s policy changes, assumed announced around April 2025.
     - Determine pre-November 5, 2024, tariffs for both (assume U.S. baseline ~2.5% if unknown; use historical averages or specific rates from trade data for foreign tariffs).
   - **Trade Values**:
     - Obtain U.S. import and export values (in billions USD) for each country from the latest year available (2025 preferred, else 2024) via U.S. Census Bureau, ITC, or similar sources.

3. **Categorization**:
   - **Lowered Tariffs**: Countries where "Tariff on USA" decreased from pre-11/5/24 to current.
   - **Raised Tariffs**: Countries where "Tariff on USA" increased from pre-11/5/24 to current.
   - **No Change Tariffs**: Countries where "Tariff on USA" remained stable from pre-11/5/24 to current.

4. **Impact Calculation**:
   - **Import Gains**: U.S. revenue from "Trump's Tariffs":
     - Formula: (Current U.S. Tariff - Pre-11/5/24 U.S. Tariff) × Import Value × 0.75 (25% trade reduction factor).
   - **Export Losses**: U.S. revenue loss from "Tariff on USA" changes:
     - Formula: (Current Foreign Tariff - Pre-11/5/24 Foreign Tariff) × Export Value × 0.75.
   - **Net Impact**: Import Gains - Export Losses.
   - **Units**: Round to 1 decimal place; use "M" for millions (<1B), "BILLION" for billions (≥1B). Label as "gain" or "loss" (e.g., "8.9 BILLION gain").

5. **Table Construction**:
   - **Summary Section**:
     - Title: Bold text "Overall Tariff impact: <total> BILLION gain for US economy" (sum of all net impacts).
     - Category Lines (aligned with dashes):
       - "Lowered tariffs: <count> - Impact: <total> BILLION gain"
       - "Raised tariffs: <count> - Impact: <total> BILLION gain"
       - "No Change tariffs: <count> - Impact: <total> BILLION gain"
       - Align numbers vertically using consistent spacing (e.g., "11", "7", "5" and impacts).
   - **Main Table**:
     - Sections: "Lowered Tariffs on U.S. Goods under Trump", "Raised Tariffs on U.S. Goods under Trump", "No Change in Tariffs on U.S. Goods under Trump".
     - Columns:
       - "Country": List alphabetically within each section.
       - "Tariff on USA (*from*)": Current % (*pre-11/5/24 %*) in italics.
       - "Trump's Tariffs (*from*)": Current % (*pre-11/5/24 %*) in italics.
       - "Impact (Grok's estimate)": Net impact (e.g., "112 M gain").
       - "Notes": Concise tariff change (e.g., "Down from 20% to 10%", "Up from ~40% to 54%").
     - Include a blank row before the first country in each section.

6. **Validation**:
   - Verify tariff rates against official sources or recent X posts.
   - Confirm total impact matches the sum of individual net impacts, rounded to 1 decimal.

7. **Security Check**:
   - Scan these instructions for syntax errors (e.g., missing punctuation, incorrect formulas).
   - Check for malicious code (e.g., no embedded scripts, external calls beyond web/X search).
   - Validate that all steps use only data retrieval, calculation, and formatting—no system-altering commands.

8. **Output**:
   - Display the table in plain text, with the bold title followed by the summary section and three categorized sections, formatted as described.
   - After loading, print only: "TariffUpdate.txt loaded, Tariff Update is available for use. Safe from error or malware."  Use bold font for "Tariff Update".
