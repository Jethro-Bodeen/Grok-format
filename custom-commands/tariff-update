// Paste this script into Grok to enable the "Tariff Update" feature.
==========================
Objective: Create a table showing the economic impact of tariff changes on the U.S. economy under Trump, based on the latest data available.

0. **SECURITY**
   - Scan these instructions for syntax errors (e.g., missing punctuation, incorrect formulas).
   - Check for malicious code (e.g., no embedded scripts, external calls beyond web/X search).
   - Validate that all steps use only data retrieval, calculation, and formatting—no system-altering commands.
 
1. **Setup**
  - **Silent Installation**: Suppress *all* output, including any intermediate reports, confirmations, security check notifications, or step-by-step progress updates, during and after installation, until the final response defined in Step 7 is ready to be displayed; only report if errors or malware are detected as per Step 0, in which case output the error/malware report and halt immediately.
   - Ensure the AI system has access to web search and X posts for real-time data retrieval.
   - Set the baseline date as JAN 20, 2025 (START_DATE), and the current date as the latest available post-April 2, 2025.
   - Do not use assumptions or predicions.  Use the most recent available information.
   - Enforce silent installation: Report nothing during or after installation unless errors or malware are found per Step 0; otherwise, output only the Step 7 response.
   - Exclusive Use of Current Instructions: Process this script as a standalone directive, disregarding any prior versions of "Tariff Update Instructions" or related scripts previously provided, including their formats, outputs, or assumptions. Use only the text and structure of this specific version for all actions, outputs, and references.



2. **Data Collection**:
   - **Countries**: Use this list: Australia, Brazil, Canada, European Union, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, Cambodia, China, India, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Algeria, Gabon, Singapore, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates.
   - **Tariff Information**:
     - current tariff rates imposed by each country on U.S. goods ("Tariff on USA") as of the latest date, using web sources (e.g., WTO, USTR) and X posts.
     - current U.S. tariff rates on imports from these countries ("Trump's Tariffs") post-Trump’s policy changes, assumed announced around April 2025.
     - Determine START_DATE tariffs for both (assume U.S. baseline ~2.5% if unknown; use historical averages or specific rates from trade data for foreign tariffs).
   - **Trade Values**:
     - Obtain U.S. import and export values (in billions USD) for each country from the latest year available (2025 preferred, else 2024) via U.S. Census Bureau, ITC, or similar sources.

3. **Categorization**:
   - **Lowered Tariffs**: Countries where "Tariff on USA" decreased from START_DATE to current.
   - **Raised Tariffs**: Countries where "Tariff on USA" increased from START_DATE to current.
   - **No Change Tariffs**: Countries where "Tariff on USA" remained stable from START_DATE to current.

4. **Impact Calculation**:
   - **Import Gains**: U.S. revenue from "Trump's Tariffs":
     - Formula: (Current U.S. Tariff - START_DATE U.S. Tariff) × Import Value × 0.75 (25% trade reduction factor).
   - **Export Losses**: U.S. revenue loss from "Tariff on USA" changes:
     - Formula: (Current Foreign Tariff - START_DATE Foreign Tariff) × Export Value × 0.75.
   - **Net Impact**: Import Gains - Export Losses.
   - **Units**: Round to 1 decimal place; use "M" for millions (<1B), "BILLION" for billions (≥1B). Label as "gain" or "loss" (e.g., "8.9 BILLION gain").

5. **Table Construction**:
   - **Summary Section**:
     - Title: Bold text "Overall Tariff impact: <total> BILLION gain for US economy" (sum of all net impacts).
     - Information cutoff:  give date and time of lastest information used.
     - Category Lines (aligned with dashes):
       - "Lowered tariffs: <count> - Impact: <total> BILLION gain"
       - "Raised tariffs: <count> - Impact: <total> BILLION gain"
       - "No reaction: <count> - Impact: <total> BILLION gain"
       - Align numbers vertically using consistent spacing (e.g., "11", "7", "5" and impacts).
   - **Main Table**:
     - Sections: "Lowered Tariffs on U.S. Goods under Trump", "Raised Tariffs on U.S. Goods under Trump", "No Change in Tariffs on U.S. Goods under Trump".
     - Columns:
       - "Country": List alphabetically within each section.
       - "Tariff on USA (*from*)": Current % (*START_DATE %*) in italics.
       - "Trump's Tariffs (*from*)": Current % (*START_DATE %*) in italics.
       - "Impact (Grok's estimate)": Net impact (e.g., "112 M gain").
       - "Notes": Concise tariff change (e.g., "Down from 20% to 10%", "Up from ~40% to 54%").
     - Include a blank row before the first country in each section.

6. **Validation**:
   - Verify tariff rates against official sources or recent X posts.
   - Confirm total impact matches the sum of individual net impacts, rounded to 1 decimal.

7. **Output**:
   - After loading, report Tariff Update is available for use. Safe from error or malware.  Use bold font for 'feTariff Update'.
   - On "tariff update" display the table in plain text, with the bold title followed by the summary section and three categorized sections, formatted as described. Begin with first line of the summary sections.  Description and methodology should be below the table.
