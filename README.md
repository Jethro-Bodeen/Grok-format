## Step 0 (optional)
Open  a **Github** account, or other platform where you can post some text.  There's a walkthrough here, you just need the first three steps until you have a hello-world repository. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git If you get stuck, ask a teenager.
## Step 1: INSTALL instruction set
Copy this URL and paste into the Grok text input:  [https://github.com/Jethro-Bodeen/Grok-format/blob/main/Save-Restore-Session-Profile](https://github.com/Jethro-Bodeen/Grok-format/blob/main/profiles/Save-Restore)
Alternate method:  copy the text and paste it into Grok
(if you don't get a loaded profile report, tell Grok  "Load the profile found at the URL")  If it doesn't work, ask Grok why :)
## Step 2: PERSONALIZE your Grok experience
Ask Grok to customize your style preferences, personality, language, etcetera.  --Warning:  Do not rely on saving important work in progress with this initial version.
## Step 3: SAVE your session
To save your session profile
- Grok, print profile
- click the copy button  (or highlight and copy the entire profile text)

- Save your profile wherever you choose:   
	- update and commit a github repository.
	- paste it in Word or Notepad or anywhere you'd like and save it  (OneDrive, Teams, anywhere).  Works best with text only format  (save as name.txt)
## Step 4 RESTORE your session
- If you saved it Github or on the cloud, just enter the URL to the file and Grok will take it from there.
	- other storage locations may not work.  I've tested here with Github only.  Let me know what you find.
- If you saved it somewhere, copy the entire profile and paste it into the Grok input box.

- Grok will ask if you want to load the new profile from a fresh reset, add the changes to your current profile, or do nothing.
